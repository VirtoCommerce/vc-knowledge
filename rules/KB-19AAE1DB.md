BL-CAT-007: Multi-FFC inventory aggregation `[P1-data]`

- **Rule:** A product's available stock on the storefront equals the sum of inventory across all fulfillment centers (FFCs) assigned to the store. If FFC-A has 10 units and FFC-B has 5 units, the storefront shows 15 available. Stock is decremented from the appropriate FFC based on fulfillment logic (closest to shipping address or priority order).
- **Verify:** Set FFC-A = 10, FFC-B = 5 → storefront shows "In stock" with effective availability of 15. Place order for 12 → FFC-A decremented first (allocation logic). Check remaining: FFC-A + FFC-B totals correct.
- **Violation signal:** Storefront shows stock from only one FFC; total doesn't match sum; decrement applied to wrong FFC; stock goes negative in one FFC while another has units.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (inventory API, FFC management), qa-frontend-expert (stock display)
