BL-SRCH-003: Search index consistency after catalog change `[P1-data]`

- **Rule:** After a product is created, updated, or deleted in Admin, the search index must reflect the change within the consistency window (BL-CROSS-009: 120s). Specifically: new product appears in search, updated product name/description changes in results, deleted product disappears from search. No ghost results for deleted products.
- **Verify:** Create product → wait 120s → search by name → found. Update name → wait 120s → search by new name → found, old name → not found. Delete product → wait 120s → search → not found.
- **Violation signal:** New product not findable after 120s; deleted product still in search results; updated fields not reflected in search; ghost/phantom results.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (search index API, Admin), qa-frontend-expert (storefront search)
