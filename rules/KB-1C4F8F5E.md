BL-PRICE-006: Price list deletion behavior `[P1-data]`

- **Rule:** Deleting a price list in Admin removes all price entries it contained. Products that relied solely on that price list become unpurchasable on the storefront. No prices should fall back to $0 — they should show as "Unavailable" or hide the "Add to Cart" button. Already-placed orders retain their historical prices.
- **Verify:** Delete a price list → storefront products show "Unavailable" (not $0) → existing orders in Admin still display original prices → re-creating a price list with same products restores storefront availability.
- **Violation signal:** Product shows $0.00 after price list deletion; "Add to Cart" remains enabled; historical order prices change retroactively.
- **Agents:** qa-backend-expert (pricing API, Admin), qa-frontend-expert (storefront display)
